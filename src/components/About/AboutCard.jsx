            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Labh Patel </span>
            from <span className="purple">Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering
            from Government Engineering College, Sector-28, under Gujarat
            Technological University.
            <br />
            With a strong academic record and a current CGPA of{" "}
            <b className="purple">8.96</b>, I strive to maintain consistency,
            discipline, and a passion for tech.
            <br />
            I recently completed a Full-Stack Developer Internship at Infosys,
            where I led the development of a Society Management System using
            modern technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, here are some things I love doing!
          </p>
